# iOS Exercise

The task consists of creating a little gallery images app using **Flickr's API**

**This app has to:**

- Show public pictures that have been taken in places nearby the current user's location
- Update pictures in real time when the user changes location (therefore the API returns different pictures)
- Pictures gallery can be a showed in a list or a grid of thumbnails
- When the user selects an image, a full-screen higher quality version of the image is expected to be presented

## Extra Points (optional)

- Implement tests
- Show the images in a map view
- Add "pinch to zoom" functionality to the full-screen view
- Universal layout (any iOS device, any orientation)

## Evaluation Criteria

1. ***Functionality***: The app works exactly as the requirements state
2. ***Code quality***: Code should be clean and follow language conventions
3. ***UI***: Design should be simple and intuitive
4. ***Performance***: App responds properly, considering the usage of optimization algorithms if necessary

## Notes

- Usage of third party dependencies is perfectly allowed
- During development, try to follow the same procedures you would apply for a real app

## Shipping

- Fork this repo and open a PR with your code against this repo's `master` branch

***Thank you for your time!***
